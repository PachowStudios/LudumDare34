This is my incomplete entry for Ludum Dare #34.

I don't have a name for it, and it isn't really much of a game ye.

Feel free to use any pieces of this in your own development.
Many of the scripts can be dropped into most games with little modification.
Even if you can't use a lot of it, I hope you can still learn something from my code.
